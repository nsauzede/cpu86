The following files were generated for 'blk_mem_40K' in directory 
D:\hdl_designs\cpu8088\website\cpu86\drigmorn1\coregen\

blk_mem_40K_flist.txt:
   Text file listing all of the output files produced when a customized
   core was generated in the CORE Generator.

blk_mem_40K.asy:
   Graphical symbol information file. Used by the ISE tools and some
   third party tools to create a symbol representing the core.

blk_mem_40K.gise:
   ISE Project Navigator support file. This is a generated file and should
   not be edited directly.

blk_mem_40K.ise:
   ISE Project Navigator support file. This is a generated file and should
   not be edited directly.

blk_mem_40K.mif:
   Memory Initialization File which is automatically generated by the
   CORE Generator System for some modules when a simulation flow is
   specified. A MIF data file is used to support HDL functional
   simulation of modules which use arrays of values.

blk_mem_40K.ngc:
   Binary Xilinx implementation netlist file containing the information
   required to implement the module in a Xilinx (R) FPGA.

blk_mem_40K.sym:
   Please see the core data sheet.

blk_mem_40K.vhd:
   VHDL wrapper file provided to support functional simulation. This
   file contains simulation model customization data that is passed to
   a parameterized simulation model for the core.

blk_mem_40K.vho:
   VHO template file containing code that can be used as a model for
   instantiating a CORE Generator module in a VHDL design.

blk_mem_40K.xco:
   CORE Generator input file containing the parameters used to
   regenerate a core.

blk_mem_40K.xise:
   ISE Project Navigator support file. This is a generated file and should
   not be edited directly.

blk_mem_40K_readme.txt:
   Text file indicating the files generated and how they are used.

blk_mem_40K_xmdf.tcl:
   ISE Project Navigator interface file. ISE uses this file to determine
   how the files output by CORE Generator for the core can be integrated
   into your ISE project.

blk_mem_gen_ds512.pdf:
   Please see the core data sheet.


Please see the Xilinx CORE Generator online help for further details on
generated files and how to use them.
